npm install
change android sdk path from android/local.properties
 
2. Run App
for Android - react-native run-android
for IOS - react-native run-ios

b. Dependencies used
1. react-native-elements , I used this dependency for Searchbar and Image element because it is simplest way to use searchbar and Image for placeholder view for images before loading.
2. Flatlist from react-native ,I used this element for List View as it is Fully cross-platform and support infinite scrolling.
